# Engineered

Engineered is my personal blog made with Django, where I will be sharing my journey as a software engineer.

## Run the application


1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/francofgp/Engineered.git
cd Engineered/
```

2. Install dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
```

If you do not have poetry just use

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run django
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

python manage.py createsuperuser # Optional if you want to create posts
python manage.py tailwind install
python manage.py runserver
```

In a seperate  console, if you want to edit the css with tailwind, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py tailwind start
```

If you don't run the command above, the css assets of tailwind will not be updated when you edit the files, thus you will not see any changes in your browser, and you will not have hot reload either.
